Older scripts and stuff. It's mostly oriented around setting up an automated
ripping workflow, where inserting a disc would trigger makemkv, which dumped
mkv files into a directory where handbrake was periodically scanning and
transcoding files to a third directory.

It worked fairly well, but I found that each movie/series generally needs
some intelligent analysis to tailor the transcoding to it for the best
results.

I try to account for that in newer scripts.
