# This is meant to be a shared config file that all the scripts here can use. It's
# new atm, and only used by one, new script to see how it works. It should be
# sourced at the beginning of any script, and then the script should validate
# that the settings are appropriate for it. There probably won't be any validation
# in this script because the validity of each setting is dependent on the script
# being run.
